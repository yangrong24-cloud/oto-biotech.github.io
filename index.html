    <div class="tagline">Engineering next-generation barrier-crossing drug delivery solutions.</div>

    <p>
      We develop innovative technologies at the intersection of immunology, infectious disease, and engineering to address unmet challenges in biotechnology, with a focus on delivery technologies to cross biological barriers.
    </p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Biological barriers, such as skin, are challenging to overcome. Existing solutions often lead to irritation, low delivery efficiency, and severe side effects.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
    <p>
      OTO Biotech builds platform technologies that enable more effective, safe, scalable,
      and unprecedentedly autonomous delivery systems to cross biological barriers. Our approach integrates advanced molecular
      design, immunology-informed delivery mechanism, and data-driven optimization to accelerate the path from discovery to real-world solutions.
    </p>

    <h2>Technology & Focus</h2>
    <p>
      Our work spans early-stage research through applied development, with current
      focus areas including novel drug delivery strategies, formulation development
      for improved treatment outcomes, and translational pathways toward industrial and
      therapeutic use.
    </p>

    <h2>Team</h2>
    <p>
      OTO Biotech is led by scientists and engineers with training in chemical
      engineering, pharmacology, and data science. We collaborate
      closely with academic and industry partners.
    </p>
